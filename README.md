>Test Repository for VG101
>Hello, VG101 Lab2. 

## What I am interested
After I explore some repositories in the Github, I find one repository which includes many algorithms in C++. 
There are many classical and renowned algorithms in programming. Let me list some of them:

### Backtracking
- N Queens
- Rat Maze

### Data Structure
- Binary Search Tree
- Queue

### Dynamic Programming
- Longest Common Subsequence

······

It involves so many important algorithms in training us how to program and communicate with the computer.
These samples will surely be a good study resource in learning C++ later.
